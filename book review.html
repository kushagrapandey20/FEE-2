    <h1><i>Of Wolves and Men</i></h1>

    <br>
    ©️1978 By Barry Lopez 
    <p><i>Scribner  Non-Fiction, Finalist National Book Award </i></p>
    <br>
    <p>Barry Lopez delves into the history, myth, and mystique of wolf/human relations with sensitivity and insight. <br>
         He melds scientific fieldwork, indigenous peoples’ wisdom, his own experience living with captive and free-ranging wolves,  <br>
         and multicultural folklore, building a rare window into the wolf's world and our perceptions of it.

        The beautifully written books takes us into the heart of what was, and in a much diminished state still is, wild and
        <br> beautiful in our United States - and it made me wonder why it is that we are so afraid. 
        <br>There are a few facts in the first chapter slightly dated by the new research coming out of Yellowstone –
        <br> however, Of Wolves and Men remains an essential and unequaled book. </p>

    Todd Strasser 
    <p><i>Todd Strasser is an American author of more than 130 novels for adults, young-adults, and middle graders. </i></p>
    <br>
    <p>BIn the middle of the night Garrett is taken from his home to Harmony Lake, a boot camp for troubled teens.<br> Maybe some kids deserve to be sent there, but Garrett knows he doesn't. Subjected to brutal <br>
        physical and psychological abuse, he tries to fight back, but the battle is futile. He won't be allowed to leave until he's admitted his "mistakes" and conformed to Harmony Lake's standards of behavior. 
        <br>And there's no way to fake it. Beaten, humiliated, and stripped of his pride, Garrett's spirit is slowly ebbing away. Then he hears whispers of an escape plot. It's incredibly risky -- if he's caught, 
        <br>the consequences will be unthinkable -- but it may be his only way out.
        In this tense, riveting novel, award-winning young adult author Todd Strasser reveals what really goes on in highly secretive -- and 
        <br>notoriously dangerous -- boot camps, a stealth prison system where any teenager under the age of eighteen can be imprisoned at his parents' whim.</p>
