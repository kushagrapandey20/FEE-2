                    BIn the middle of the night Garrett is taken from his home to Harmony Lake, a boot camp for troubled teens. Maybe some kids deserve to be sent there, but Garrett knows he doesn't. Subjected to brutal <br>
                        physical and psychological abuse, he tries to fight back, but the battle is futile. He won't be allowed to leave until he's admitted his "mistakes" and conformed to Harmony Lake's standards of behavior. 
                        And there's no way to fake it. Beaten, humiliated, and stripped of his pride, Garrett's spirit is slowly ebbing away. Then he hears whispers of an escape plot. It's incredibly risky -- if he's caught, 
                        the consequences will be unthinkable -- but it may be his only way out.
                        In this tense, riveting novel, award-winning young adult author Todd Strasser reveals what really goes on in highly secretive -- and 
                        >notoriously dangerous -- boot camps, a stealth prison system where any teenager under the age of eighteen can be imprisoned at his parents' whim.

                <p><strong>Author:</strong> Dave Kindred</p>
                <p><strong>Published On :</strong> February 22, 2022</p>
                <p><strong>Review:</strong>"My Home Team" is an engaging and heartfelt memoir by Dave Kindred, offering a poignant exploration of the profound impact small-town football can have on a community and an individual's life. As a seasoned sportswriter, Kindred brings his sharp observational skills and deep empathy to this touching narrative, creating a book that resonates on multiple levels.
                    The memoir begins with Kindred's reflections on his distinguished career covering major sports events and personalities. Despite his professional achievements, he felt a growing disconnect from the stories that initially fueled his passion for writing. This sense of dislocation is the catalyst for his return to his hometown of Atlanta, Illinois, where he reconnects with the local high school football team.</p></td></tr></table>

                    <td align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p> <b> <strong>Summary :-</strong></b>Barry Lopez delves into the history, myth, and mystique of wolf/human relations with sensitivity and insight. <br>
                        He melds scientific fieldwork, indigenous peoples’ wisdom, his own experience living with captive and free-ranging wolves,  <br>
                        and multicultural folklore, building a rare window into the wolf's world and our perceptions of it.
               
                       The beautifully written books takes us into the heart of what was, and in a much diminished state still is, wild and
                        beautiful in our United States - and it made me wonder why it is that we are so afraid. 
                       There are a few facts in the first chapter slightly dated by the new research coming out of Yellowstone –
                   however, Of Wolves and Men remains an essential and unequaled book.
